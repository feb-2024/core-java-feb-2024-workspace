data types - categories
-----------------------
	1. primitive data types
	2. non-primitive/ derived data types
	
1. primitive data types
----------------------
	- 8 primitive data types
		
		integers
		--------
		byte - 1 byte
		short - 2 bytes
		int - 4 bytes
		long - 8 bytes
		
		decimal numbers
		---------------
		float
		double
		
		boolean - true / false
		
		char
		
	- these primitive datatypes starts with small letter
	- these primitive datatypes are not objects
	
2. non-primitive/derived data types
-----------------------------------
	- arrays, classes, interfaces, enum
	- these are called derived data types because they are derived from the primitive data types 	
	
	
literals - fixed values
 
type casting
------------
	1. implicit casting
	2. explicit casting
