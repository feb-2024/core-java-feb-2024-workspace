data types - categories
-----------------------
	1. primitive data types
	2. non-primitive/ derived data types
	
1. primitive data types
----------------------
	- 8 primitive data types
		
		integers
		--------
		byte - 1 byte
		short - 2 bytes
		int - 4 bytes
		long - 8 bytes
		
		decimal numbers
		---------------
		float
		double
		
		boolean - true / false
		
		char
		
	- these primitive datatypes starts with small letter
	- these primitive datatypes are not objects
	
2. non-primitive/derived data types
-----------------------------------
	- arrays, classes, interfaces, enum
	- these are called derived data types because they are derived from the primitive data types 	
	
	
literals - fixed values
 
type casting
------------
	1. implicit casting
	2. explicit casting
	
connection between int and char

----------
1. diff between System.out.print() and System.out.println()
	- System.out.print() - prints the output and cursor remains in the same line
	- System.out.println() - prints the output and cursor moves to a new line
	- Do we have System.out.printf() in java?
	
2. what is keyword, identifier and literal?
	keyword - Keywords are reserved words and these are predefined in Java which cannot be used as identifiers
	identifier - sequence of characters to identify something in program. 
			   - Eg: variable names, class names, package names, interface names, method names 
	literal - fixed values
	
3. Operators in Java
	categories
		- Arithmetic operators
			+ - * / %
		- Assignment operator
			=
		- Arithmetic assignment operator
			+= -+ *= /= %=
		- Relational operators
			< <= > >= == !=
		- Logical operators
			&& || !
		- Bitwise operators
			& | ! ^ << >> >>>
		- Ternary operator
			int c = a>b?a:b;
		- Increment/Decrement operator
			++ --

	- 3 main sections of any program
		- input
			Scanner class which is java.util package
		- process
			use operators, flow control stmts, looping stmts
		- output
			System.out.println()
		
	- input from user
		- Scanner class
	
	- how to get the primitive data types as input from the user?
		- scan.nextByte() 
		- scan.nextShort()
		- scan.nextInt()
		- scan.nextLong()
		- scan.nextFloat()
		- scan.nextDouble()
		- scan.nextBoolean()
		- how do we get a char as input using Scanner?
		
		- scan.next()
		- scan.nextLine()
		
		- we know next() and nextLine() is used to scan String input. What is the difference between next() and nextLine()? 
		
	- what is 
		System.out	- refers to output/console/monitor
		System.in - refers to the input/keyboard
		System.err - refers to error output
