data types - categories
-----------------------
	1. primitive data types
	2. non-primitive/ derived data types
	
1. primitive data types
----------------------
	- 8 primitive data types
		
		integers
		--------
		byte - 1 byte
		short - 2 bytes
		int - 4 bytes
		long - 8 bytes
		
		decimal numbers
		---------------
		float
		double
		
		boolean - true / false
		
		char
		
	- these primitive datatypes starts with small letter
	- these primitive datatypes are not objects
	
2. non-primitive/derived data types
-----------------------------------
	- arrays, classes, interfaces, enum
	- these are called derived data types because they are derived from the primitive data types 	
	
	
literals - fixed values
 
type casting
------------
	1. implicit casting
	2. explicit casting
	
connection between int and char

----------
1. diff between System.out.print() and System.out.println()
	- System.out.print() - prints the output and cursor remains in the same line
	- System.out.println() - prints the output and cursor moves to a new line
	- Do we have System.out.printf() in java?
	
2. what is keyword, identifier and literal?
	keyword - Keywords are reserved words and these are predefined in Java which cannot be used as identifiers
	identifier - sequence of characters to identify something in program. 
			   - Eg: variable names, class names, package names, interface names, method names 
	literal - fixed values
	
3. Operators in Java
	categories
		- Arithmetic operators
			+ - * / %
		- Assignment operator
			=
		- Arithmetic assignment operator
			+= -+ *= /= %=
		- Relational operators
			< <= > >= == !=
		- Logical operators
			&& || !
		- Bitwise operators
			& | ! ^ << >> >>>
		- Ternary operator
			int c = a>b?a:b;
		- Increment/Decrement operator
			++ --

----------	
	- 3 main sections of any program
		- input
			Scanner class which is java.util package
		- process
			use operators, flow control stmts, looping stmts
		- output
			System.out.println()
		
	- input from user
		- Scanner class which is in util package
		- Scanner is a utility class given to us by java
		- Scanner class uses the classes in java.io package to get input from the user
	
	- how to get the primitive data types as input from the user?
		- scan.nextByte() 
		- scan.nextShort()
		- scan.nextInt()
		- scan.nextLong()
		- scan.nextFloat()
		- scan.nextDouble()
		- scan.nextBoolean()
		- how do we get a char as input using Scanner?
		
		- scan.next() - used for string input
		- scan.nextLine() - used for string input
		
		- we know next() and nextLine() is used to scan String input. What is the difference between next() and nextLine()? 
		
	- what is 
		System.out	- refers to output/console/monitor
		System.in - refers to the input/keyboard
		System.err - refers to error output

Decision making statements
----------------------------
	- if statements
		- simple if
		- if...else
		- else if ladder
		- nested if
		
	- switch statements
		- In Java, switch works only with 4 primitives and their wrappers, as well as with the enum type and String class.
		This is

			byte — Byte
			short — Short
			char — Character
			int — Integer
			Enum
			String

some of the important java features from java 8 to java 17
----------------------------------------------------------
java 8
------
	- lambda expressions and Stream API
	- Method References
	- Default methods
	- Type Annotations
	- Repeating Annotations
	- Method Parameter Reflection
java 9
------
	- Java Module System
	- try with resources
	- Diamond Syntax with Inner Anonymous Class
	- Private Interface Methods
java 10
-------
	- Introduction of var
java 11
-------
	- use of var inside lambda expressions
java 14
-------

-------
	- pattern matching of instanceof
	- Records
java 17
-------
	- Sealed classes

Looping statements in java
--------------------------
	- used when we want to perform a task multiple times
	- when working with loops be careful not to write an infinite loop
	- every time when the loop runs, we have to make sure that we are getting one step closer to ending the loop.
	- for a loop to run what do we need?
		- initial value : intial value on which the loop starts
		- condition : condition to enter the loop
		- expression (mostly inc/dec) : this expression will help us to get one step closer to the condition becoming false

	- generally to run a loop we use a variable and we call this as running variable
	- sometimes we may use the running variable in the repeated task that we want to perform 
	- while loop
		- is an entry control loop
	- do...while loop
		- is a exit control loop
		- the body of the loop will definetly execute once
	- for loop
		- here the initial value, condn and exp is given in the same line
		- it is convenient
		- is for loop an entry control or exit control loop?  - for loop is a entry control loop
		
29/03/2024
-----------
	- patterns in java using nested for loops
	- available in PatternLoopDemo.java
	- Also shared the java simple practise questions in github
	
01/04/2024
----------
	- methods in java
	- terminologies
		- method declaration
		- method definition
		- method invocation
		- method signature
			- can have methods with
				- no return type and no arguments
				- no return type and have arguments
				- with return type and no arguments
				- with return type and have arguments
	- working with methods involves 2 steps
		1. method definition
			- here we specify the method signature along with the method body
			- by writing the definition of the method , the method body does not get executed
		2. method invocation	
			- in order for the body of the method to execute, we should call the method
	
02/04/2-24
-----------
	- command line arguments
		- these are argument sent to the main method at the time of running the program
		- these argument could be values needed for the main method to intialize resources
		- created a demo program CommnadLineArgDemo.java
	- created a menu driven program for TwoDShapes
	
03/04/2024
-----------
	- classes and objects are the building blocks of object oriented programming
	
	
	- classes in java
		- a class is a design/blueprint/sketch/template/prototype
		- what can a class contain?
			- data members/properties/variables/fields/attributes  
			- member functions/methods  
		- eg:
				class Person {
					String name;
					double height;
					double weight;
					String gender;
					// int noOfKeys; // no meaning
					
					boolean run(){
						// code here
					}
					
					boolean sleep(){
						// code here
					}
					
					boolean eat(){
						// code here
					}
					
					// boolean magnify(){ // no meaning
					// }
				}

		- memory structure
			stack memory
				- local variables will take memory in stack
				- a local variable if not initialized will hold garbage value
			heap memory
				- instance variables/data members take memory in heap 
				- an instance variable if not initialized will hold default values
					byte, short, int, long is 0
					float, double is 0.0
					boolean is false
					char is '\o'
					String is null

	- objects in java : create an object of Room class and accessed its members
	- stack and heap memory
	- local variable and instance variable memory allocations
	- local variable and instance variable default values
	- memory when methods are invoked
	- garbage collector
	- create multiple objects for Room

----------
	- constructors in java
		- what are contructors?
			- a special method
				- constructors don't have a return type, not even void
				- constructor has the same name as the name of the class
				- constructors are called automatically when an object is created
		- the purpose of constructors are to initialize the instance variables
		- if we do not provide a constructor in a class, a default constructor(has no arguments) is provided by the compiler	
			- this can be verified by using the command javap
			- javap command can introspect a class and list its structure
		- the moment we provide a constructor in the class the compiler no longer provides the default constructor
		- constructor overloading
			- a class can have multiple constructors with different arguments
			- different arguments means either of them are different
				- no. of arguments
				- the type of arguments are different
				- the order of arguments
		- constructor chaining
			- we can call one constructor from another constructor within the class
			- this is achieved by this()

	- 4 pillars of OOPS
		- Inheritence
		- Polymorphism
		- Encapsulation
		- Abstraction
	- Inheritence
		- Here one(new) class Inherits the members(properties and methods) of another(existing) class
		- the existing class is called parent/base/super class
		- the new class which extends from the existing class is called child/derived/sub class
		- we use the "extends" keyword to inherit
		- we get the is-a relation through inheritance  
		- Deriving a classes from existing class 
		- parent child relation	
		- inheritence gives us code reusability
		- types of inheritence
			- single level inheritence
			- multi level inheritence
			- hirarchial inheritence
			- hybrid inheritence
			- multiple inheritence ( not supported by java)  public class A extends B, C ----------> this is not possible
		- relation between 2 classes
			- is-a relation
				- means one class extends another class
				- so is-a means inheritence
			- has-a	relation
				- how is this acheived? find out the answer before 10th april class
				- what is composition and aggregation? find answer for this as well
10/04/2024
----------
	- question
		- lets say we have a multilevel inheritence
			class A {
				A () { 
				//super(); automatically introduced by the compiler if you have not provided a super() statement
				System.out.println("A"); }
			}
			class B extends A {
				B () { 
				//super(); automatically introduced by the compiler if you have not provided a super() statement
				System.out.println("B"); }
				}
			class C extends B {
				C () { 
				//super(); automatically introduced by the compiler if you have not provided a super() statement
				System.out.println("C"); }
			}
			class D extends C {
				D () { 
				//super(); automatically introduced by the compiler if you have not provided a super() statement
				System.out.println("D"); }
			}
			class Main{
				D d = new D();
			}
		
		- what is the output? 
			ans:
				A
				B
				C
				D
				
		- in which order will the constructors be called?
			ans:
				first D,s constructor os called and since first line is uper(), then c's constructor is called
		
	- Polymorphism 
		- the next pillar of OOPS
		- poly means many and morphism means forms - so more than one form
		- types of polymorphism
			- compile time polymorphism
				- here static binding takes place and hence is also called static polymorphism
				- method overloading is an example of compile time polymorphism
				- method overloading means same method name with different arguments
				- different arguments means either of them should be different
					- no. of arguments
					- order of arguments
					- type of argument 
				- we do not consider the return type in method overloading
				- method overloading can be achieved between a super class and a sub class or with a class
				- also note that inheritence is not a pre-requisite of method overloading
				- what is the purpose of method overloading?
					- Vinod Chandra 19:44
						increses readability of the program and also provides flexibility for 
						programmers so that they can call the same method for different types of data.
					- mere convinience
						Eg: println() method is overloaded
								int x = 30;				
								System.out.println(x);
								String msg = "hello";
								System.out.println(msg);
								boolean flag = true;
								System.out.println(flag);
								
			- runtime polymorphism
				- here dynamic binding takes place and hence is also called dynamic polymorphism
				- method overriding is an example of runtime polymorphism
				
	- has-a	relation
				- how is this acheived? pushed till answer is found out
				- what is composition and aggregation? find answer for this as well

Runtime polymorphism
	- here dynamic binding takes place and hence is also called dynamic polymorphism
	- method overriding is an example of runtime polymorphism
	- is inheritence a pre requisite for method overriding? - YES
	- what is method overriding?
		- Ankit Raj 18:47
				Method overriding in object-oriented programming refers to the ability of a subclass to 
				provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
		- Kora Bhoomika 18:49
				method overriding involves creating a method in the child class that has the same 
				name, parameters, and return type as a method in the parent class
		- Archana Erra 18:49
				overriding a function requires a subclass or child class to provide a variety of method 
				implementations, that are already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes, in 
				any object-oriented programming language
		- the method in the sub class is called the overriding method
		- the method in the super class is called overridden method
		- when we create an object of the sub class, the overriding method of the sub class is called when invoked.
		- here the sub class method masks the super class method
		- while overiding we consider the method name(same), method parameters(same) and the return type(same) as well.
		- Vinod Chandra 19:03
				@Override
					This annotation helps the compiler to check if a method is actually overriding a method from the superclass. 
					If there is a mismatch in the signature, the compiler will generate an error.

	- a super class reference/object variable can point to a subclass object
			Animal animal2 = new Dog();
	- what is dynamic/late/runtime polymorphism?

----------
Encapsulation
	- What is encapsulation?
		- D BHAVANAGIRI 17:56
			Wrapping up of data and function into to a single unit is called encapusulation.
		
		- K. KUSUMA 17:59
			Hiding of data
		
		- Ankit Raj 17:59
			- encapsulation is the mechanism of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit
			- It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposes the necessary functionalities through methods......
	- how can we acheive all the above said definition? - through access specifiers
	- what are the access specifiers?
		- Vinod Chandra 18:07
				access specifiers are keywords used to define the accessibility of classes, methods, and fields,constructors within a class
		- acheived through
			- public
			- protected
			- default/no modifier
			- private
		
	- these access specifiers is used in front the members of the class
	
	- tabulate
								within class		within package		outside package+extended classes		outside package
		public						yes					yes						yes									yes
		protected					yes					yes						yes									no
		default/no modifier			yes					yes						no									no
		private						yes					no						no									no
		
	- hiding the data members by making it private and provide public getters/setters
	- getter methods are also called as accessors
	- setter methods are also called as mutators
	- getter/accessor gives the read access of the variable
	- setter/mutator gives the write access of the variable

Abstraction
	- what is abstraction?
		- Ankit Raj
			fundamental concept that allows to hide complex implementation details and only show the necessary features of an object
		- Emaaz Khot
			hiding the implementation details of a class and showing only the essential features of the object
	- how is abstarction acheived?
		- through abstract classes and interfaces
	- abstract classes
		- what is an abstract class?
			- a class which has atleast one abstract method
		- what is an abstract method?
			- a method which is declared inside an abstract class and has no method body
		- can I instantiate(create object of) an  abstract class?
			No we cannot instantiate an abstract class. Abstract classes are incomplete classes. They dont have 
			the complete implementation of the methods.
		- abstract classes are also called as incomplete classes
