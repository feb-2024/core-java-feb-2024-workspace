data types - categories
-----------------------
	1. primitive data types
	2. non-primitive/ derived data types
	
1. primitive data types
----------------------
	- 8 primitive data types
		
		integers
		--------
		byte - 1 byte
		short - 2 bytes
		int - 4 bytes
		long - 8 bytes
		
		decimal numbers
		---------------
		float
		double
		
		boolean - true / false
		
		char
		
	- these primitive datatypes starts with small letter
	- these primitive datatypes are not objects
	
2. non-primitive/derived data types
-----------------------------------
	- arrays, classes, interfaces, enum
	- these are called derived data types because they are derived from the primitive data types 	
	
	
literals - fixed values
 
type casting
------------
	1. implicit casting
	2. explicit casting
	
connection between int and char

----------
1. diff between System.out.print() and System.out.println()
	- System.out.print() - prints the output and cursor remains in the same line
	- System.out.println() - prints the output and cursor moves to a new line
	- Do we have System.out.printf() in java?
	
2. what is keyword, identifier and literal?
	keyword - Keywords are reserved words and these are predefined in Java which cannot be used as identifiers
	identifier - sequence of characters to identify something in program. 
			   - Eg: variable names, class names, package names, interface names, method names 
	literal - fixed values
	
3. Operators in Java
	categories
		- Arithmetic operators
			+ - * / %
		- Assignment operator
			=
		- Arithmetic assignment operator
			+= -+ *= /= %=
		- Relational operators
			< <= > >= == !=
		- Logical operators
			&& || !
		- Bitwise operators
			& | ! ^ << >> >>>
		- Ternary operator
			int c = a>b?a:b;
		- Increment/Decrement operator
			++ --

----------	
	- 3 main sections of any program
		- input
			Scanner class which is java.util package
		- process
			use operators, flow control stmts, looping stmts
		- output
			System.out.println()
		
	- input from user
		- Scanner class which is in util package
		- Scanner is a utility class given to us by java
		- Scanner class uses the classes in java.io package to get input from the user
	
	- how to get the primitive data types as input from the user?
		- scan.nextByte() 
		- scan.nextShort()
		- scan.nextInt()
		- scan.nextLong()
		- scan.nextFloat()
		- scan.nextDouble()
		- scan.nextBoolean()
		- how do we get a char as input using Scanner?
		
		- scan.next() - used for string input
		- scan.nextLine() - used for string input
		
		- we know next() and nextLine() is used to scan String input. What is the difference between next() and nextLine()? 
		
	- what is 
		System.out	- refers to output/console/monitor
		System.in - refers to the input/keyboard
		System.err - refers to error output

Decision making statements
----------------------------
	- if statements
		- simple if
		- if...else
		- else if ladder
		- nested if
		
	- switch statements
		- In Java, switch works only with 4 primitives and their wrappers, as well as with the enum type and String class.
		This is

			byte — Byte
			short — Short
			char — Character
			int — Integer
			Enum
			String

some of the important java features from java 8 to java 17
----------------------------------------------------------
java 8
------
	- lambda expressions and Stream API
	- Method References
	- Default methods
	- Type Annotations
	- Repeating Annotations
	- Method Parameter Reflection
java 9
------
	- Java Module System
	- try with resources
	- Diamond Syntax with Inner Anonymous Class
	- Private Interface Methods
java 10
-------
	- Introduction of var
java 11
-------
	- use of var inside lambda expressions
java 14
-------
	- switch expressions (different syntax for writing switch case)
	- the yield keyword
java 15
-------
	- text blocks ("""   """) ( similar to the back tick symbol(template strings) in Javascript)

java 16
-------
	- pattern matching of instanceof
	- Records
java 17
-------
	- Sealed classes

Looping statements in java
--------------------------
	- used when we want to perform a task multiple times
	- when working with loops be careful not to write an infinite loop
	- every time when the loop runs, we have to make sure that we are getting one step closer to ending the loop.
	- for a loop to run what do we need?
	

	- while loop
	
	- do...while loop
	
	- for loop
